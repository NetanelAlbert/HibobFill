    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: August 2023</p>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This privacy policy describes how the HiBob Attendance Helper extension ("we", "our", or "extension") handles your information when you use our Chrome extension.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>Our extension collects and processes the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your HiBob user profile information (display name and avatar) to show in the extension popup</li>
        <li>Your HiBob attendance data, including missing attendance days and timesheet information</li>
        <li>Your extension settings (preferred work hours and time offset preferences), which are stored locally in your browser using Chrome storage API</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data is processed locally within your browser. We do not transmit or store your data on external servers. Your settings are saved using Chrome's storage API and remain on your device.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This extension interacts exclusively with the HiBob application (app.hibob.com) using your existing logged-in session. We do not send your data to any other third-party services.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy in the extension.</p>
    
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact the extension developer through the Chrome Web Store support channel.</p>
    
    <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>This extension is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or connected to HiBob in any way. This is an unofficial extension created by independent developers to enhance the HiBob user experience.</p>
